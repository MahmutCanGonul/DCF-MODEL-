🍎What is DCF Model?

 Discounted cash flow analysis is the best method available for assessing the intrinsic value of a business, it has several limitations.
 
 One issue is that the terminal value represents a disproportionately large amount of the value of the total business, and the assumptions used to calculate the terminal value (perpetual growth or exit multiple) are very sensitive.

Another issue is that the discount rate used to calculate net present value is very sensitive to changes in assumptions about the beta, risk premium, etc. Finally, the entire forecast for the business is based on operating assumptions that are nearly impossible to accurately predict.

DCF Model Formula:

CFn => Cash Flow
r => Rate
n => Periods

               DCF =>  CFn / (1+r)^n


🍎KEYS:

💣Discounted cash flow (DCF) helps determine the value of an investment based on its future cash flows.

💣The present value of expected future cash flows is arrived at by using a discount rate to calculate the DCF.

💣If the DCF is above the current cost of the investment, the opportunity could result in positive returns.

💣Companies typically use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the discount rate, because it takes into consideration the rate of return expected by shareholders.

💣The DCF has limitations, primarily in that it relies on estimations of future cash flows, which could prove inaccurate.
